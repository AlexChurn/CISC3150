Kant?s
 ethics are organized around the notion of a ?categorical imperative,? which is
a universal ethical principle stating that one should always respect the humanit
y in others, and that one should only act in accordance with rules that could ho
ld for everyone. Kant argued that the moral law is a truth of reason, and hence
that all rational creatures are bound by the same moral law. Thus in answer to t
he question, ?What should I do?? Kant replies that we should act rationally, in
accordance with a universal moral law.
